    This function iterates through a list of auction solutions, evaluates the
    winners and their rewards using a specified auction mechanism, and optionally
    removes orders already executed. The results are aggregated for further
    analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    auction_solutions_list : list[list[Solution]]
        A list of auction solutions where each solution represents a possible
        outcome in the auction.
    mechanism : AuctionMechanism
        The auction mechanism used to determine the winners and their rewards
        based on the provided solutions.
    remove_executed_orders : bool, optional
        If True, excludes already-settled orders from the analysis. Defaults to
        True.

    Returns
    -------
    list[tuple[list[Solution], dict[str, tuple[int, int]]]]
        A list of tuples, where each tuple corresponds to the winners and their
        rewards for the respective solutions in the input list. Each tuple contains
        a list of winners and a dictionary mapping solvers to their rewards.

        The original solution object containing all trades and associated metadata.
    order_uids : set[str]
        A set of unique IDs representing the orders to be removed from the solution.

    Compute and display statistics for multiple auction mechanisms, including metrics

    solutions generated by auction mechanisms and the associated winners and rewards data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    auction_solutions_list : list of list of Solution
        A nested list where each sub-list contains `Solution` objects proposed
        during the auction processes.
    all_winners_rewards : list of list of tuple(list of Solution, dict of str to tuple of int, int)
        A nested list of tuples representing the winners and corresponding rewards

        list of `Solution` objects representing the winners and a dictionary where
        keys are order identifiers (str) and values are tuples representing rewards

    None
        This function does not return any value. It prints the statistics for each

    Notes
    -----
    - The function iterates over the range of auction mechanisms to calculate the total
      scores from winners, total rewards, and throughput efficiency for every mechanism.
    - Throughput represents the percentage of orders settled immediately as soon as a
      solution is proposed.
    - The summary results for scores, rewards, and throughput are printed to the console
      along with relative changes or increases compared to the benchmark mechanism.
    - Statistical values, such as scores and rewards, are converted to ETH and formatted
      for better readability.
